```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=animal_shelter_api;uid=[uid];pwd=[pwd];"
  }
}
```
5. _Replace_ [uid] _and_ [pwd] _with your created SQL username and password respectively_ _(_including the braces_)._

### Create a local schema

## API Documentation
_Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser._

### Using Swagger Documentation
* _After entering `dotnet run` in the 'AnimalShelterApi' you will then open your web browser_
* _Type this_ 'https://localhost:1992/swagger/index.html' _in the browser or_ 'http://localhost:2000/swagger/index.html'

### Note on Versioning
* _There are two different version of this API_
* _If you are using swagger you can click on the top right rectangle that has a 'v1' to switch between the two versions_
* _If you are using Postman you will need to specify which version you are using in the URL_
* _Here are two examples 'https://localhost:1992/api/v1/Animals' and 'https://localhost:1992/api/v2/Animals'_

### Note on Pagination
* _Version 2 is the ONLY version that utilizes pagination_
* _By default it will show you 5 results per page_
* _You can navigate to page two by modifying the page number in the URL_
* _Here's an example 'https://localhost:1992/api/v2/Animals?pageNumber=1&pageSize=5'_
* Please note that there are only two pages. Would recommend using the URL given previously
* _To see the default enter the URL like this 'https://localhost:1992/api/v2/Animals'_

### Endpoints
_These are base URL's:
Base URL:_ `https://localhost:2000` _or_ `https://localhost:1992`

### HTTP Request Structure
_Here I will show you how to utilize GET for all animals, POST, GET for a specific animal, PUT, and DELETE_
* _A good GET request you should receive a status code of "200 ok" that let's you know the request was a success. When you send a POST request you will receive a "201" code to indicate a successful request. When you send a PUT and DELETE request you will receive a "204" code letting you know it worked._
* _Also anything with a 400 or 404 indicates that the request was bad; double-check that the request was written properly._

This is the http request structure.

```
GET /api/{version}/{component}
POST /api/{version}/{component}
GET /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
PUT /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
DELETE /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
```

#### Example Query
```
https://localhost:1992/api/v2/Animals
```
#### Sample JSON Response
```
{
  "animalId": 1,
  "name": "remy",
  "description": "monster",
  "type": "human",
  "date": "2023-02-20T22:34:43.594"
}
```
